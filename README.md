##Demo site created as an example object oriented php. 



Key files will be found in the "inc" dir:

**classes.php** 
Creates the class TEAM, which contains several properties ( ie. name, home, ect. ) and a constructor method. There is also a method called getInfo that creates a string for the presentation layer. 


**teams.php**
Creates four instances of the TEAM class using it's constructor method and creates an array of them. 


**index.php**
Finally a for loop is used to iterate through the array calling get info. The result is the display of the properties as mark up.

#####I have incorporated info gained from [learnhowtoprogram](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com) and [treehoouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-php-basics)
